[![Build Status](https://focs.ji.sjtu.edu.cn:2222/api/badges/ENGR151-21/pgroup-09/status.svg)](https://focs.ji.sjtu.edu.cn:2222/ENGR151-21/pgroup-09)

## Workflow

Clone and setup your identity for this git repo
```
git clone ssh://git@focs.ji.sjtu.edu.cn:2222/ENGR151-21/your_pgroup_repo.git
cd your_pgroup_repo
git config user.name "studentid"
git config user.email "sjtu email"
```

### Development process

1. each student work on a different branch
2. when a task or feature is completed, issue a pull request to `dev` branch
3. carefully test your work on the `dev` branch, and when all bugs have been fixed issue a PR to `master`
4. if at any stage you get stuck with a merge conflict contact the teaching team

Ways to avoid merge conflicts:
- when sharing the work avoid overlap
- ensure each student work on different functions/classes
- as soon as you have finished working for the day push to your personal branch
- as soon as you have completed a task (eg. ufo completed) issue a PR to `dev`

Name your files as you wish and update `src/Makefile` and/or `src/CMakeLists.txt` accordingly

### Final recommendations

- Do not wait the last minute to get started
- If after a few days you have not found your teammates, please contact the teaching team
- At the beginning spend much more time discussing and designing your software than coding

All along the project, meet with your teammates on a regular basis and discuss your progress. If you meet any issue contact the teaching team as early as possible.
